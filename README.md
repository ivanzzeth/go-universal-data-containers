# go-universal-data-containers
Universal Data Containers (UDC) provides standardized interfaces for common data structures with multiple backend implementations. It enables developers to write environment-agnostic code that can seamlessly transition between in-memory (for testing) and production-ready backends (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) without changing application logic.
